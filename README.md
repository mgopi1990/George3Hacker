# George3Hacker
Simple recursion problem.

George is a deadly hacker ;). He has broken into the security systems of one of the reputed organisation to steal Administrator's password. However , the IT guys there are smart too. The password is stored in an encrypted format and not in plain text. George put up all his reverse engineering skills to crack the passwords. He has managed to get an integer N. Assuming all password consists of alphabets only (bad practise though), the ascii value of each letter of password add to form N. Since you are the best programmer in town, he asked for your help to write down a program that can generate all possible passwords which George can brute force upon. Please help him :D

Input :
100 < N < 10000
Output :
all possible passwords that make up N

Sample Input:
195
Sample Output:
AAA

Explanation : AAA consists of three letters all being A with ascii value as 65 . If we sum them up we get 65+65+65= 195 . No other combination Qualifies.
