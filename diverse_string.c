/*
 * We consider alphabet with only three letters: 'a', 'b' and 'c'. 
 * A string is called diverse if no three consecutive letters are the same. 
 * In other words, a diverse string may not contain any of the strings 
 * 'aaa', 'bbb', or 'ccc'. 
 * 
 * Write a function,
 *  string_diverse (int A, int B, int C);
 * 
 * that given three integers A, B and C, returns any longest possible diverse 
 * string containing at most A letters 'a', at most B letters 'b' and at most 
 * C letters 'c'. If there is no possibility of building any string, return 
 * empty string. 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 1. Given A=6, B=1 and C=1, our function may return, 'aabaacaa'. 
 * Note that 'aacaabaa' would also be a correct answer. 
 * Your function may return any correct answer.
 * 
 * 2. Given A=1, B=3, and C=1, your function ay return 'abbcb', 'bcbab', 'bacbb' 
 * or any serveral other strings.
 * 
 * 3. Given A=0, B=1 and C=8, your function should return 'ccbcc' which is the 
 * only correct answer for this case.
 * 
 * Assume that,
 *  A,B,C are integers within the range [0..100],
 *  A+B+C > 0
 * 
 * In your solution focus on correctness. 
 * The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
